Yes, please centralize it.
Create a single source of truth for graft ASP data and update the three pages to import from it. Also add a simple quarterly versioning pattern so Q4 updates are one edit in one file.

Step-by-step instructions for the Replit agent

Goal: Remove duplicate GRAFT_OPTIONS arrays from:

client/src/pages/calculator.tsx

client/src/pages/patient-profile.tsx

client/src/pages/public-calculator.tsx

…and replace them with a single import from shared/constants/grafts.ts, with a minimal quarter/year versioning helper.

1) Add a shared constants file

Create: shared/constants/grafts.ts

// shared/constants/grafts.ts
export type Quarter = 'Q1' | 'Q2' | 'Q3' | 'Q4';

export interface GraftOption {
  manufacturer: string;
  name: string;
  /** CMS Q-code as displayed to users; keep the -Q# suffix for clarity */
  qCode: string;
  /** Billable rate per cm² for the given quarter */
  asp: number;
  year: number;
  quarter: Quarter;
  /** Hide from selectors if discontinued this quarter */
  isActive: boolean;
}

/**
 * Single source of truth.
 * Keep the CURRENT quarter’s data exported as GRAFT_OPTIONS.
 * Move last quarter’s array into HISTORY if needed.
 */
export const GRAFT_OPTIONS: GraftOption[] = [
  // === Q3 2025 (CURRENT EXAMPLE FROM AGENT MESSAGE) ===
  { manufacturer: "Biolab",     name: "Membrane Wrap",        asp: 1190.44, qCode: "Q4205-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Biolab",     name: "Membrane Hydro",       asp: 1864.71, qCode: "Q4290-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Biolab",     name: "Membrane Tri Layer",   asp: 2689.48, qCode: "Q4344-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Dermabind",  name: "Dermabind Q2",         asp: 3337.23, qCode: "Q4313-Q2", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: false }, // example: carried over / inactive
  { manufacturer: "Dermabind",  name: "Dermabind Q3",         asp: 3520.69, qCode: "Q4313-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Revogen",    name: "Revoshield",           asp: 1468.11, qCode: "Q4289-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Evolution",  name: "Esano",                asp: 2675.48, qCode: "Q4275-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Evolution",  name: "Simplimax",            asp: 3071.28, qCode: "Q4341-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "AmchoPlast", name: "AmchoPlast",           asp: 4415.97, qCode: "Q4316-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
  { manufacturer: "Encoll",     name: "Helicoll",             asp: 1640.93, qCode: "Q4164-Q3", year: 2025, quarter: "Q3", isActive: true },
];

/** Optional: keep older quarters here if you want an audit trail. */
export const GRAFT_HISTORY: GraftOption[][] = [
  // e.g., push prior arrays here when rolling to a new quarter.
];

/** Convenience helpers */
export const getActiveGrafts = () => GRAFT_OPTIONS.filter(g => g.isActive);

/** If any UI needs the shape without metadata */
export const toSimpleOptions = () =>
  getActiveGrafts().map(g => ({
    manufacturer: g.manufacturer,
    name: g.name,
    qCode: g.qCode,
    asp: g.asp,
  }));

2) Replace local constants with imports

In each of the three pages:

Remove the local const GRAFT_OPTIONS = [...].

Add:

import { getActiveGrafts, toSimpleOptions } from "../../shared/constants/grafts";
// Adjust relative path as needed per file location


If the page expects the original shape (manufacturer, name, qCode, asp), swap usages to toSimpleOptions().

If it can use richer data (quarter/year/isActive), use getActiveGrafts() directly.

Example replacement (typical select options):

const grafts = toSimpleOptions(); // single source of truth

3) Ensure forms & calculators don’t break

Where the code previously referenced GRAFT_OPTIONS, update to toSimpleOptions() or getActiveGrafts().

Keep UI labels the same (e.g., show name and qCode).

Add a defensive check where prices are used:

if (!selectedGraft) {
  // Show toast: “Please select a graft”
  return;
}

4) Q4 update workflow (document this in a comment atop grafts.ts)

For each new quarter:

Copy the current GRAFT_OPTIONS array into GRAFT_HISTORY (optional but recommended).

Overwrite GRAFT_OPTIONS with the Q4 list:

Update asp values per graft.

Update qCode suffix to “-Q4” if applicable.

Set year: 2025, quarter: "Q4".

Set isActive to false for removed grafts, or delete them entirely if you prefer. (We recommend leaving them with isActive:false for audit clarity.)

Save, run, and verify all three pages load the updated list.

5) Small DX niceties (fast, optional)

Add a tiny unit check to ensure no duplicate (manufacturer, name, qCode) tuples and that all asp > 0.

Add a /health/grafts backend endpoint that returns { count: getActiveGrafts().length } so we can sanity-check after deploy.

// server/routes/health.ts (example)
app.get("/health/grafts", (_req, res) => {
  const { getActiveGrafts } = require("../../shared/constants/grafts");
  res.json({ ok: true, count: getActiveGrafts().length });
});
