# ⚠️ CRITICAL DATABASE WARNING ⚠️

## CURRENT STATUS: DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION SHARE THE SAME DATABASE

**This means ANY changes you make during development IMMEDIATELY affect your live deployment!**

### What this means:
- ❌ Deleting patients in development = Deleting real patients in production
- ❌ Adding test data = Adding test data to live system  
- ❌ Modifying treatments = Modifying real user data

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **STOP testing destructive operations** (delete, major edits)
2. **Use only ADD operations** for safe testing (add test patients/treatments)
3. **Set up proper database separation** before continuing development

### Safe Testing Options:
1. Add test patients with clearly marked names like "TEST - Do Not Use"
2. Only test CREATE operations, not DELETE/UPDATE
3. Export/backup data before any testing

### Next Steps:
Contact your database administrator or Replit support to set up proper development/production database separation.

**DO NOT CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE**
